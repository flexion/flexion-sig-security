# Flexion Security Playbook

1. Security is multi-layered. You need to balance organization, cloud/infrastructure, and application security requirements, and they are all not the same thing.
2. Inventory, inventory, inventory: you cannot manage what you cannot measure, and it is hard to secure things you forget about. This is the first routine security practice you need!
3. How do we balance so many different security requirements? Model your security posture for your system and periodically review security requirements. Threat model early and often.
4. Leverage existing frameworks, libraries, and tools which follow good security practices themselves; and do not be shy to ask for colleague recommendations about them, especially if you do not know which ones follow good security practices.
5. Embrace routine security checks: make them early, make them repeatable, make them unavoidable (you will eventually automate them, because this conviction will keep you too busy).
6. Understand your inputs and outputs, especially those controlled or manipulated by users and are outside of complete application control; know how to validate them, know how to sanitize them, know how to encode and decode them. Be sure to ask for help and advice!
7. Your security modeling and data modeling should strongly inform each other: understand your data and how to protect data as it is saved, how it moves through application components, and how it is transferred to other systems, trusted or untrusted.
8. You want everyone in your team to fall into ["The Security Pit of Success"](https://medium.com/@ricomariani/pit-of-success-for-organizations-a046a0eae7b2). There's a spectrum with security on one end and usability on the other. Target the right amount of usability so secure development, deployment, and operations require the least effort.
